## ðŸ’» Local Setup

This project consists of a **Spring Boot backend** and an **Angular frontend**. To run the full application, you'll need to set up both parts.

### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Java 17 or higher**
* **Maven**
* **Node.js & npm**
* **Git**
* **A database** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

### ðŸš€ Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal and clone the Git repository.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/goprudent.git](https://github.com/your-username/goprudent.git)
    cd goprudent/backend
    ```

2.  **Create the `.env` file:**
    In the `backend` directory, create a new file named **`.env`** and add your database credentials.

    ```
    DB_USERNAME=your_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    DB_URL=your_db_url
    ```

    *The format for **DB_URL** depends on your specific database. For example, for MySQL, it might look like: `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/goprudent_db`.*

3.  **Build the project:**
    Use Maven to build the project. The `-DskipTests` flag will skip the test compilation and execution, making the build faster.

    ```bash
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    You can run the application directly from your IDE by running the `GoPrudentApplication.java` file or by using the Maven command below.

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    The backend will start and typically run on `http://localhost:8080`.

### ðŸš€ Frontend Setup (Angular)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    From the root of the cloned repository, move into the `frontend` folder.

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Use npm to install all the required Angular packages.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Angular development server:**
    This command will compile the Angular application and launch it on a local server.

    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:4200`. Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the full GoPrudent application in your browser.
